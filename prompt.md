4. **Real-time sync**: Firebase integration from day one, not retrofitted
5. **User testing**: Validate flows with actual camping groups during development

The resulting website should feel like a comprehensive camping trip coordinator that makes group planning effortless and even enjoyable, replacing the chaos of group text threads with an organized, collaborative platform.
